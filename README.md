These are some of the projects that I have done in the university. 
The first few projects start from basic data analysis with Python, which after the later projects are more advanced and include descriptive data analysis with visualization. 
Finally, in the last project I have done some exploratory data analysis and used Python to make predictions by creating prediction and classification models.
